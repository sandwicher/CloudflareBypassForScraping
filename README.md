# 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping.git
cd CloudflareBypassForScraping
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

### Using Docker directly
```bash
# Pull and run the latest image
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/sarperavci/cloudflarebypassforscraping:latest
```

## Manual Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

# Usage

## Request Mirroring (Any HTTP Method)

Request mirroring is a new technique that allows you to forward any HTTP request through the Cloudflare bypass server. That lets you to handle seamlessly both clearance cookie generation and SSL/TLS fingerprinting challenges.

Simply, change your API base URL to point to the local server and add the `x-hostname` header with the target hostname. You can add other headers or body as needed.

```bash
# GET request
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/data" -H "x-hostname: example-site-protected-with-cf.com"

# POST request  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/submit" \
  -H "x-hostname: cf-protected-website.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

Initial request will generate and cache Cloudflare cookies, subsequent requests will use cached cookies automatically. 

### Miscellaneous Headers

- `x-hostname`: Target hostname (required)
- `x-proxy`: Proxy URL (optional) 
- `x-bypass-cache`: Force fresh cookies (optional)

These three headers let you control the bypassing behavior per request. You can set them as needed.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/data" \
  -H "x-hostname: protected-site.com" \
  -H "x-proxy: http://user:pass@proxyserver:port" \
  -H "x-bypass-cache: true"
```

### Basic Cookie Extraction

The `/cookies` endpoint allows you to get Cloudflare cookies for a specific URL without mirroring a request. A random Firefox version on a random OS is used as the user agent.

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost:8000/cookies?url=https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare"
```
```json
{
  "cookies": {
    "cf_clearance": "SJHuYhHrTZpXDUe8iMuzEUpJxocmOW8ougQVS0.aK5g-1723665177-1.0.1.1-5_NOoP19LQZw4TQ4BLwJmtrXBoX8JbKF5ZqsAOxRNOnW2rmDUwv4hQ7BztnsOfB9DQ06xR5hR_hsg3n8xteUCw"
  },
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:145.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/145.0"
}
```

### HTML Content Extraction

The `/html` endpoint returns the full HTML content of a page after bypassing Cloudflare protection. The HTML is returned directly (not as JSON).

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost:8000/html?url=https://nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare"
```

This returns the raw HTML content with additional headers containing bypass information:
- `x-cf-bypasser-cookies`: Number of cookies generated
- `x-cf-bypasser-user-agent`: User agent used for bypass
- `x-cf-bypasser-final-url`: Final URL after redirects
- `x-processing-time-ms`: Time taken to process the request


## Build from Source  
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t cloudflare-bypass .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 cloudflare-bypass
```

# Backward Compatibility

Existing integrations continue to work unchanged:

```bash
# Legacy endpoint still works
curl "http://localhost:8000/cookies?url=https://example.com"

# Old bypass server - I'm keeping it as alternative method
pip install -r old_server_requirements.txt
python old_server.py
```
